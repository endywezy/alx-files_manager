This project outlines the steps to build a simple file manager backend API using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Redis, and other tools. Here's a breakdown of the functionalities and how you can test them:

1. Setting Up and Dependencies:

The project uses Node.js (version 12.x.x) and npm for package management. Ensure you have them installed on your system.
Provided files include package.json, .eslintrc.js, and babel.config.js. Run npm install to install the dependencies listed in package.json.
2. Redis and MongoDB Utilities:

Create a file named utils/redis.js containing a RedisClient class with functions for connecting, checking connection status, getting, setting, and deleting data in Redis.
Test the connection with redisClient.isAlive().
Use redisClient.get and redisClient.set to store and retrieve data (e.g., set a key-value pair and retrieve it later).
Similarly, create utils/db.js for interacting with MongoDB. The DBClient class should handle connecting, checking connection status, counting users and files in the database.
Test the connection with dbClient.isAlive().
Use dbClient.nbUsers and dbClient.nbFiles to get user and file counts.
Testing:

You can run these functionalities in a separate script to test their behavior. Write unit tests (using frameworks like Mocha) to ensure they work as expected.
3. Basic API Endpoints:

The server starts in server.js and loads routes from routes/index.js.
routes/index.js defines endpoints for the functionalities. Implement the controllers in controllers/.
Create endpoints for:
/status (GET): Returns the status of Redis and MongoDB connection (using previously created utilities).
/stats (GET): Returns the number of users and files in the database (using the DBClient methods).
Test these endpoints using tools like curl:
Bash
curl http://localhost:5000/status ; echo ""
curl http://localhost:5000/stats ; echo ""
Use code with caution.

4. User Management:

Implement user creation in controllers/UsersController.js for the /users (POST) endpoint.
The endpoint should accept email and password in the request body.
Store the password securely after hashing it (e.g., using SHA1).
Return the newly created user with only email and ID on successful creation (status code 201).
Implement error handling for missing email, password, or duplicate email (status code 400).
Testing:

Use curl with appropriate headers and JSON data to create a user:
Bash
curl -XPOST http://localhost:5000/users -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "email": "test@example.com", "password": "password123" }' ; echo ""
Use code with caution.

Verify the response contains the newly created user information and status code 201.
Test error handling for missing fields or duplicate emails.
5. Authentication:

Implement authentication in controllers/AuthController.js.
Define endpoints for:
/connect (GET): Allows users to sign in with Basic Auth (email:password encoded as Base64) and generates a token stored in Redis for 24 hours.
/disconnect (GET): Allows users to sign out by deleting their token from Redis.
/users/me (GET): Retrieves user information (based on the token) for authenticated users.
Return the generated token on successful login (status code 200) or appropriate error messages (status code 401) for unauthorized access.
Testing:

Use curl with Basic Auth header to obtain a token:
Bash
curl -XGET http://localhost:5000/connect -H "Authorization: Basic dGVzdEBleGFtcGxlLmNvbTpwYXNzව්ඕird123" ; echo ""
Use code with caution.

Test user information retrieval using the token in the X-Token header:
Bash
curl -XGET http://localhost:5000/users/me -H "X-Token: <your_token_here>" ; echo ""
Use code with caution.

Verify the response contains user information and status code 200.
Test unauthorized access by removing the token or using
